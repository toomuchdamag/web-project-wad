				  <h1>International Year Zero (IYZ)</h1>
				  <h3>Key Details</h3>
				  <p><strong>Award:</strong> Foundation <br> <strong>Duration:</strong> One year full-time <br> <strong>Location:</strong> DMU Dubai campus</p>
				  <h3>Course overview</h3>
				  <p> The International Year Zero (IYZ) is an essential gateway program that offers specialized pathways into various undergraduate degree programs at DMU Dubai, including business, law, social sciences, engineering, computing, and art and design. <br><br>The curriculum for each pathway is designed to equip students with the foundational knowledge and skills needed for their chosen fields. It focuses on enhancing English language proficiency, developing effective study habits, and providing in-depth subject knowledge. Additionally, the program familiarizes students with DMU’s teaching methodologies, feedback mechanisms, and assessment practices, thereby preparing them to meet the challenges of their degree programs and achieve future success.<br><br> Upon enrollment in the IYZ, students will declare their intended degree; however, they have the flexibility to switch to another program within the same discipline if necessary. <br><br> To ensure smooth progression into their chosen degrees, students will undertake English for Academic Purposes (EAP) and are required to attain a minimum IELTS score of 6.0 (or 6.5 for Psychology). This thorough preparation is crucial for their academic journey ahead.</p>
				  <h3>Key Features</h3>
				  <p>The curriculum is designed to provide newcomers to a discipline with a solid foundation, enabling them to develop essential skills and create a portfolio that supports their successful transition into their chosen undergraduate program. <br><br> For those who already possess some experience in their selected field, the curriculum will strengthen and expand their existing knowledge and capabilities. <br><br> These programs feature innovative teaching and learning strategies, offering specialized pathways across various subject areas. <br><br> The English for Academic Purposes (EAP) curriculum emphasizes the development of language skills and discipline-specific expertise. Its unique design aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), making De Montfort University the only higher education institution in the UK designated as a global hub for one of the SDGs—specifically SDG 16, which aims to promote peace, justice, and strong institutions. <br><br> Teaching staff in specialized areas are also involved in the degree programs, ensuring that IYZ students have a strong connection to their future departments and the campus. Program leaders, who are highly experienced professionals, are dedicated to delivering a quality education and are available to address any questions or concerns regarding the accreditation process or course content. <br><br> The program's diverse student body creates valuable opportunities for networking and gaining broader cultural insights throughout the IYZ year, which will benefit graduates in their future degrees and career paths. Additionally, this program includes a four-year option that integrates the International Year Zero for applicants with non-standard entry qualifications.</p>
